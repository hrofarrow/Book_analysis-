  - **Hypothesis** - Page Count will have an inverse relationship with both voter count and rating

# Hypothesis #2 - Voter Count vs. Rating

- **Hypothesis** - If a book has more ratings, the average rating will be less extreme and have a lower standard deviation.
- **Results** - Ratings trended towards a more neutral and less volatile outcome as number of votes increased

# Hypothesis #3 - Publisher vs. Average Price

- **Hypthesis** - If a given publisher publishes more books, then their published books will have a higher price.
- **Results** - When looking at the top ten publishers, there was a slight positive correlation between number of books published per publisher, and average price per publisher. However, when looking at all publishers, there seemed to be no consistent relationship between the two. 

# Hypthesis #4 - Page Count vs. Price

- **Hypothesis** - If the number of pages of a book affects the book price then books with a higher page count will have a higher price
- **Results** - There was a slight positive correlation between page count and price. 

# Hypothesis #5 - Season Published vs. Price

- **Hypothesis** - If a book is published in a specific season, then its popularity and price will not be higher than other months.
- **Results** - Popularity and price had no correlation to the season published. However, number of books produced was correlated to the season published.
