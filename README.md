Analysis of book data for Project 1

Project Title: New York Times Book Analysis 
Team Members: Catherine Smith, Jackson Yaggi, Molly Oesterling, Helena O'Farrow 

Project Description: 
  For this project, we will be analyzing data from a random list of books from the Google Books Dataset and we will be comparing different aspects of the list including price, publisher, and date to get understand the world of books. 

Research Questions: 
  1. Does the number of pages of a book effect the number of the votes that the book recieves? 
  2. Is there a publisher that publishes most books or most popular books? 
  3. Does the amount of votes affect the overall rating of the book? 
  4. Do you pay for more pages? 
  5. Do some publishers produce more expensive books? 
  6. Do some publishers publish their books during a specific time of the year? 
  
Datasets to be used: 
  CSV Files 
  
Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
    The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.


         Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s): Helena


         Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process: Catherine 


         Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data): Each person choses a                  question to make visualizations for. 


         Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation: Everyone 

         
         Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis: Everyone - broken down by question


         Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a              short description of what you found and any relevant plots.: Everyone submits information - Jackson and Molly create the formal writeup.
