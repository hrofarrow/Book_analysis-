Analysis of book data for Project 1

Project Title: New York Times Book Analysis 
Team Members: Catherine Smith, Jackson Yaggi, Molly Oesterling, Helena O'Farrow 

Project Description: 
  For this project, we will be analyzing data from the New York Times best seller list from the years 2008-2018. We will be drawing comparisons for ranking, price, weeks on the best seller list, and dates of publication. 

Research Questions: 
  1. Does price affect how long the book is on the best seller list? 
  2. Does how long it is on the list affect the ranking? 
  3. How long from publication date does it take to get on the best seller list? 
  4. What are the most popular authors over the time period? 
  
Datasets to be used:

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
    The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows:


         Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s): Helena


         Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process: Catherine 


         Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data): Each person choses a                  question to make visualizations for. 


         Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation: Everyone 

         
         Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis: Everyone - broken down by question


         Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a              short description of what you found and any relevant plots: Everyone submits information - Jackson and Molly create the formal writeup.
